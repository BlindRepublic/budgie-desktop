# budgie-translations

Budgie Desktop Translations is the official translations repository for the [Budgie Desktop](https://github.com/solus-project/budgie-desktop). All changes here come from two places:

1. Manual updating of the base `budgie-desktop.pot` file
2. Our [Weblate Instance](https://translate.getsol.us)

## Why not just commit to budgie-desktop directly?

Unfortunately with the departure of the project founder, we were not left in a position for push access capabilities to be granted to our bot by a member of the Core Team. As such, this repository is intended to be used as a git submodule with `budgie-desktop`.
